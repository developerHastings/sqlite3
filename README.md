Task Ideas:
Create two vectors of size 4 with any numbers; add and subtract them.

Multiply a vector by a scalar.

Create two 3×3 matrices and add them.

Multiply a matrix by a scalar.

Use indexing to print:

Slice the first two elements of a vector and the first two rows of a matrix.

# Tuesday 29th July Exercise
Multiply two 2×2 matrices and check your answer by hand and with NumPy.
Create an identity and zero matrix in NumPy; demonstrate that A x I = A and A + Z = A
Apply a scaling and rotation transformation to a set of 2D points; visualize with Matplotlib.

Experiment with changing the transformation matrix to see effects (try reflection, shearing, etc.).


# Wednesday 30th July Exercise
Create several matrices—check and interpret their rank.

Calculate and interpret eigenvalues/eigenvectors for simple 2x2 matrices.
Visualize how a matrix transformation stretches along eigenvector directions.

# Monday 04th August Exercise
1. Write a Python function to compute the numerical derivative of any user-supplied function at any point
2. Use your function to compute the derivative of f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x at several points.
3. Show how small vs large dx affects the accuracy of your numerical derivative
-Compute and print the derivative at x = 1 for different values of dx
-Observe how the numerical approximation improves or becomes unstable.
4. Create a plot showing both a function and its numerical derivative on the same graph

# Tuesday 5th August Exercise 

Compute Gradients for Multivariable Functions — Given function: f(x, y) = 3x^2y + 2*y^3.
(a) Compute analytically the partial derivatives ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y. 
(b) Write a Python function for f(x, y).
(c) Implement a function to compute the partial derivatives numerically at (x=1, y=2).

# Wednesday 6th August 2025 Exercise
Implement gradient descent to minimize the function:
f(x) = x^2 + 2*x + 1
(the minimum is at x = -1)

# Tuesday 12th August 2025 Exercise
